## Description
It is difficult these days to find easy to make, fun, and delicious recipes. We are looking to remedy this. Simply type in and search a food item you are craving and our application will provide you with the top 6 recipes. Also, the Tasty Tasty App will give you the option to receive the top beverages to pair with your desired recipe. Deliciousness awaits!

## Using our Application
Upon loading our website, use the search box to input your desired food item. Next, select from the dropdown menu if you would also like a beverage pairing to go with your recipe. Finally, click on the search button and you will receive the Top 6 Recipes for that food item. If you selected the beverage pairing option, you will also be given beverages that go best with your recipes.
