GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Acolyte03/Recipe-Finder <br />
Tasty Tasty Website:

# Objective:
Using 2 free APIs to design, create, and implement a front-end application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## Description

It is difficult these days to find easy to make, fun, and delicious recipes. <br />
We are looking to remedy this. <br />
Simply type in a food item you are craving and our application will provide you with the top 6 recipes. <br />
Also, the Tasty Tasty App will provide you with some wonderful beverage pairings to go along with your desired recipe.


## Using our Application
Upon loading our website, use the search box to input your desired food item. <br />
Next, select from the dropdown menu if you would also like a beverage pairing to go with your recipe. <br />
Finally, click on the search button and you will receive the Top 6 Recipes for that food item. <br />
If you selected the beverage pairing option, you will also be given beverages that go best with your recipes.

## What We Have Learned

## Reflection and Future Improvement
Unfortunately not everything that was planned was able to be completed. Due to time and budget restraints, some ideas didnt make it into our application. If budget and time were not an 
issue, we would include the following in our application.
1. Improve UI styling which includes getting rid of the temporary cards that exist before our user searches.
2. Allow our user to further customize their search. For example, the user would be able to search by most popular or the newest receipe/beverage.
3. Make our applications homepage more easily understood at a glance and accessible to all users.
4. Go from having two search buttons to only a single search button to search for food and beverages simultaneously.
5. Insure that our website works at a higher percentage due to how our current API and websites format data.
